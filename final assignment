1. %run ../Includes/Classroom-Setup
2. Create a new Delta table called fireCallsPartitioned partitioned by Priority.
   a. CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY VIEW fireCallsParquet
      USING parquet
      OPTIONS (path "/mnt/davis/fire-calls/fire-calls-clean.parquet/")
      OK
   b. CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS Databricks;
      USE Databricks;
      DROP TABLE IF EXISTS fireCallsPartitioned;
      CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE fireCallsPartitioned
      USING DELTA
      PARTITIONED BY (Priority)
      AS 
      SELECT * FROM fireCallsParquet;
3. How many folders were created? Enter the number of records you see from the output below (include the _delta_log in your count)?
    a. %fs ls dbfs:/user/hive/warehouse/databricks.db/firecallspartitioned
4. Delete all the records where City is null. How many records are left in the delta table?
    a. DELETE FROM fireCallsPartitioned WHERE City IS NULL;
5. After you deleted all records where the City is null, how many files were removed? Hint: Look at operationsMetrics in the transaction log using the DESCRIBE HISTORY command.
    a. DESCRIBE HISTORY fireCallsPartitioned;
6. There are quite a few missing Call_Type_Group values. Use the UPDATE command to replace any null values with Non Life-threatening. After you replace the null values, how many Non Life-threatening call types are there?
    a. SELECT Call_Type_Group, COUNT(*) AS Counts
       FROM
       fireCallsPartitioned
       GROUP BY
       Call_Type_Group;
7. Travel back in time to the earliest version of the Delta table (version 0). How many records were there?
    a. SELECT COUNT(*)
       FROM fireCallsPartitioned
       VERSION AS OF 0
